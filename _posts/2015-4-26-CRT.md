#Chinese Remainder Theorem

It is an algorithm to solve simultaneous linear congruences. Consider
```
x = a_1 (mod n_1)
x = a_2 (mod n_2)
x = a_3 (mod n_3)
```
If n_1, n_2, n_3 are **relatively coprime**, then solutions to this set exists. 

Let `N = n_1 * n_2 * n_3`. Then, if x' is one solution to these equations, then
the general set of solutions is `x = x' (mod N)`.

##Algorithm

We define 
```
N_1 = N / n_1
N_2 = N / n_2
N_3 = N / n_3
```
Then we solve the following linear congruences:
```
N_1 * x = 1 (mod n_1)
N_2 * x = 1 (mod n_2)
N_3 * x = 1 (mod (n_3)
```
Let the solutions be `x_1, x_2, x_3`.

Then one solution is `x' = a_1*N_1*x_1 + a_2*N_2*x_2 + a_3*N_3*x_3`. And the
general solution can be found using the above congruence.

##Application

Quite often we use CRT to take the modulo of a number with a number that is not
prime. Or, let's say we have a congruence in which `a*x = b (mod n)`, where `n`
is not prime. In these cases, we factorize `n` to split the modulo operations
into a number of such congruences, solve them individually and then combine them
using CRT.
